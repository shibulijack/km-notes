<B>KMSLC Approaches</B></A>
</H1>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Primarily due to lack of standardization, a number of approaches
have been proposed for KMSLC. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Refer to Table 3.2 in page 65 of
your textbook for a list of representative approaches, and 
refer to Figure 3.3 in page 66 of
your textbook for a proposed hybrid life cycle.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The conventional systems development approach can still be used for 
developing KM systems, but it is usually being replaced by iterative 
design, prototyping etc. 

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<B>Evaluating the Existing Infrastructure</B>

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>
KM systems are developed in order to satisfy the need for 
improving productivity and potential of employees and the company as a 
whole. The existing knowledge infrastructure is evaluated so that it can 
give the perception that the present ways of doing things 
are not just abandoned in preference for a new system.

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>
<B>System Justification:</B>
It involves answers to the following 
questions:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Is existing knowledge going to be lost through retirement, , 
   transfer, or departure to other organizations?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Is the proposed KM system needed in multiple locations?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Are experts available and willing to support the building of the 
     proposed KM system?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Does the concerned problem needs years of proper experience and 
      cognitive reasoning to solve?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>While undergoing knowledge capture, would it be possible for the 
       expert to articulate how the problem will be solved?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>How critical is the knowledge that is to be captured?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Are the involved tasks nonalgorithmic in nature?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Would it possible to find a champion within the organization?    

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Scoping:</B>
According to the textbook, the term <I>scoping</I> means <I>limiting the breadth and depth of the project within the financial,
human resource, and operational constraints</I>.

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Feasibility:</B> Feasibility study involves addressing the following 
questions:

<UL>
<LI>Is it possible to complete the project within the expected timeframe?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Is the project affordable?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Is the project appropriate?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>How frequently the system would be consulted at what will be associated 
cost?

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

can be used for building a KM system. This involves the following tasks:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Forming a knowledge management team.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Preparing a master plan.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Performing cost/benefit analysis of the proposed system.

<LI>How much involvement can be expected from the user while the
building process continues?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>What type of users training will needed when the proposed system
is up and running?

<B>Role of Strategic Planning</B>

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>

<UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Identifying the key units, branches, divisions etc. as the key 
stakeholders in the prospective KM system.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Strategically, technically, and organizationally balancing the team 
size and competency.

experience, and communication skill).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Size of the team.

<P>

<B>Capturing Knowledge</B>

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Capturing Knowledge involves extracting, analyzing and interpreting 
the concerned knowledge that a human expert uses to solve a specific 
problem.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Explicit knowledge is usually captured 
in repositories from appropriate documentation, files etc.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Tacit knowledge is usually captured from experts, and from 
organization's stored database(s).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Interviewing is one of the most popular methods used to capture 
knowledge. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Data mining is also useful in terms of using <I>intelligent agents</I>
that may analyze the data warehouse and come up with new findings.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In KM systems development, the knowledge developer acquires the 
necessary heuristic knowledge from the experts for building the 
appropriate knowledge base.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Knowledge capture and knowledge transfer are often carried out through 
teams (refer to Figure 2.4).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Knowledge capture includes determining feasibility, choosing the 
appropriate expert, tapping the experts knowledge, retapping knowledge
to plug the gaps in the system, and verify/validate the knowledge base
(refer to Table 3.4 in page 76 of your textbook).

<B>The Role of Rapid Prototyping</B>

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>In most of the cases, knowledge developers use <I>iterative</I>
approach for capturing knowledge.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Foe example, the knowledge developer may start with a <I>prototype</I>
(based on the somehow limited knowledge captured from the expert during 
the first few sessions).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The following can turn the approach into rapid prototyping:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Knowledge developer explains the preliminary/fundamental procedure
    based on rudimentary knowledge extracted from the expert during 
    the few past sessions.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The expert reacts by saying certain remarks.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>While the expert watches, the knowledge developer 
      enters the additional knowledge into the computer-based system 
      (that represents the prototype).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The knowledge developer
      again runs the modified prototype and continues adding additional 
      knowledge as suggested by the expert till the expert is satisfied.  

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The spontaneous, and iterative process of building a knowledge base
 is referred to as <I>rapid prototyping</I>.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Expert Selection</B>

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>
The expert must have excellent communication skill to be able to 
communicate information understandably and in sufficient detail.

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>
Some common questions that may arise in case of expert selection:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>How to know that the so-called expert is in fact an expert?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Will he/she stay with the project till its completion?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>What backup would be available in case the expert loses interest 
or quits?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>How is the knowledge developer
going to know what does and what does not lie within the
expert's area of expertise?

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>
<B>The Role of the Knowledge Developer</B>

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The knowledge developer
can be considered as the architect of the system.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>He/she identifies the problem domain, captures knowledge, writes/tests
the heuristics that represent knowledge, and co-ordinates the entire 
project.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Some necessary attributes of knowledge developer:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Communication skills.

<P>

This phase involves the following two steps:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Verification Procedure:</B> Ensures that the system is right, i.e., 
the programs do the task that they are designed to do.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Validation Procedure:</B> Ensures that the system is the right
system - it meets the user's expectations, and will be usable on demand.

<P>
<B>Implementing the KM System</B>

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>After capturing the appropriate knowledge, encoding in the knowledge
base, verifying and validating; the next task of the knowledge
developer is to implement the proposed system on a server.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Implementation means converting the new KM system into actual 
operation.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><I>Conversion</I> is a major step in case of implementation.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Some other steps are <I>postimplementation review</I> and
<I>system maintenance</I>.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Reasoning errors

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Ambiguity

<P>

<P>
<B>Training Users</B>         

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The level/duration of training depends on the user's 
knowledge level and the system's attributes.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Users can range from <I>novices</I> (casual users with very limited 
knowledge)
to <I>experts</I> (users with prior IT experience and knowledge of 
latest technology).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Users can also be classified as <I>tutors</I> (who acquires a working 
knowledge in order to keep the system current), <I>pupils</I> (unskilled 
worker who tries to gain some understanding of the captured knowledge), or 
<I>customers</I> (who is interested to know how to use the KM system).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Training should be geared to the specific user based on capabilities, 
experience and system complexity.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Training can be supported by user manuals, explanatory facilities, and 
job aids.

<B>Managing Change</B>

<P>

<P><P>
