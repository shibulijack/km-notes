<B>The People Core</B>

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>By <I>people</I>, here we mean knowledge workers, managers, customers,
and suppliers.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>As the first step in 
knowledge architecture, our goal is to evaluate the existing information/
documents which are used by people, the applications needed by them, the 
people they usually contact for solutions, the associates they collaborate 
with, the official emails they send/receive, and the database(s) they 
usually access. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>All the above stated resources help to create an employee <I>profile</I>,
which can later be used as the basis for designing a knowledge management
system.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The idea behind assessing the people core is to do a proper job in 
case of assigning job content to the right person and to make sure that
the flow of information that once was obstructed by departments now
flows to right people at right time.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In order to expedite knowledge sharing, a knowledge network has to be 
designed in such a way as to assign people authority and responsibility
for specific kinds of knowledge content, which means:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Identifying knowledge centers:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>After determining the knowledge that people need, the next step is 
        to find 
        out where the required knowledge resides, and the way to capture 
        it successfully.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Here, the term <I>knowledge center</I> means areas in the 
        organization where knowledge is available for capturing.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>These centers supports to identify expert(s) or expert teams in 
        each center who can collaborate in the necessary knowledge capture
        process.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Activating knowledge content satellites

<P>

<UL>
<LI>This step breaks down each knowledge center into some more
        manageable levels, satellites, or areas.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Assigning experts for each knowledge center:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>After the final framework has been decided, one manager should 
        be assigned for each knowledge satellite who will ensure integrity 
        of information content, access, and update.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Ownership is a crucial factor in case of knowledge capture,
        knowledge transfer, and knowledge implementation.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In a typical organization, departments usually tend to be 
        territorial.    

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Often, fight can occur over the budget or over the control of 
        sensitive processes (this includes the kind of knowledge a 
        department owns).   

<P>
</LI>
<LI>These reasons justify the process of assigning department 
        ownership to knowledge content and knowledge process.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>adjacent/interdependent departments should be cooperative and ready 
        to share knowledge.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The objective of the technical core is to enhance communication as well 
as
ensure effective knowledge sharing.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Technology provides a lot of opportunities for managing tacit knowledge 
in
the area of communication.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Communication networks create links between necessary databases.	

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Here the term <I>technical core</I> is meant to refer  
to the totality of the required hardware, software, and the specialized 
human resources.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Expected attributes of technology under the technical core: Accuracy, 
speed, reliability, security, and integrity.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Since an organization can be thought of as a knowledge network, the 
goal of knowledge economy is to push employees towards greater efficiency/
productivity by making best possible use of the knowledge they posses.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A knowledge core usually becomes a network of technologies designed 
to work on top of the organization's existing network.

<UL>
<LI>Usually a web browser represents the interface between the user and the 
KM system.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>It is the top layer in the KM system architecture.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The way the text, graphics, tables etc are displayed on the screen
tends to simplify the technology for the user.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The user interface layer should provide a way for the proper flow of 
tacit and explicit knowledge.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The necessary knowledge transfer between people and technology involves 
capturing tacit knowledge from experts, storing it in knowledge base, and 
making it available to people for solving complex problems.

<P>

<LI>Features to be considered in case of  user interface design:

<LI>An organization's intranet represents the internal network of 
communication systems.
